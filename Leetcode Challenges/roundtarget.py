# Given an array of prices [p1,p2...,pn] and a target, round each price pi to Roundi(pi) so that the rounded array [Round1(p1),Round2(p2)...,Roundn(pn)] sums to the given target. Each operation Roundi(pi) could be either Floor(pi) or Ceil(pi).

# Return the string "-1" if the rounded array is impossible to sum to target. Otherwise, return the smallest rounding error, which is defined as Î£ |Roundi(pi) - (pi)| for i from 1 to n, as a string with three places after the decimal.
