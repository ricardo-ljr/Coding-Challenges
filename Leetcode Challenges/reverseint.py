# Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.

# Note:
# Assume we are dealing with an environment that could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−231,  231 − 1]. For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.

class Solution:
    def reverse(self, x: int) -> int:
        sign = [1, -1][x < 0]
        rev, x = 0, abs(x)
        while x:
            x, mod = divmod(x, 10)
            rev = rev*10 + mod
        return sign*rev if -pow(2, 31) <= sign*rev <= pow(2, 31)-1 else 0
